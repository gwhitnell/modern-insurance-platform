## 🧠 Design Principles

This platform is built using modern data engineering best practices:

- **Layered Architecture**
  - RAW → CLEAN → ANALYTICS separation
- **Incremental Processing**
  - Snowflake Streams + Tasks for change data capture
- **Transformation Framework**
  - dbt for modular, testable transformations
- **Infrastructure as Code**
  - Terraform manages all Snowflake resources
- **Security & Governance**
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Environment Separation**
  - DEV and PRD databases for safe deployment

## 🔐 Roles & Responsibilities

| Role            | Access Level |
|-----------------|-------------|
| ROLE_LOADER     | Insert into RAW |
| ROLE_TRANSFORM  | Full access to CLEAN & ANALYTICS |
| ROLE_ANALYST    | Read-only access to ANALYTICS |

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Snowflake (Data Platform)
